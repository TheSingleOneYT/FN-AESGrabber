# FN-AESGrabber
Grabs the latest AES keys from [Benbot's AES Endpoint](https://benbotfn.tk/api/v1/aes) and writes them automatically to a .txt file.

# Usage
*Run the program and open the .txt file created at the end! You can then copy the AES keys into [UModel](https://github.com/gildor2/UEViewer) or use them for something else!
